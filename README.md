# Blockchain-Fundamentals-Project
# Blockchain Voting DApp

# Project Title
Decentralized Voting Application

# Description
The Blockchain Voting DApp is a decentralized application (DApp) built on the Ethereum blockchain. It enables users to conduct secure and transparent voting processes with the use of smart contracts. The smart contract, written in Solidity, manages the entire voting process, ensuring integrity and immutability.

# Technologies Used

# Smart Contract Development
Solidity
Ethereum Blockchain (MetaMask)
Hardhat (Development Environment)
Ethers.js

# Frontend Development
React.js
Web3.js (JavaScript library for interaction with Ethereum)

# # Styling 
CSS

# Version Control
Git
Other Tools
GitHub and Visual Studio Code 

# Project Structure
The project follows a client-server architecture, with the smart contract constituting the backend (on-chain) logic, and the React application serving as the frontend (off-chain) user interface.
This combination of technologies ensures a seamless and secure decentralized voting experience for users.

# Getting Started
To deploy and interact with the Blockchain Voting DApp, follow the instructions.
